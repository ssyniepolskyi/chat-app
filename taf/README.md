# Chat Application Testing Suite

## Overview
This repository contains the automated test suite for a chat application using Cypress. The tests cover user authentication (login, registration, and logout), as well as chat functionality (sending messages, viewing message history). This project implements behavior-driven design (BDD) to ensure that each feature meets user requirements and performs as expected.
